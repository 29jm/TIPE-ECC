all fields of equal order are isormorphic (which isomorphism?).
F_p/(P(X)) with p prime and P in F_p[X] irreducible of degree n is a field of order p^n.
a field of order p^n has characteristic p.
existence of irreducible polynomial in F_p[X].
the non-zero elements of a finite field form a multiplicative, cyclic group. existence of primitive element.
Z/pZ is a field iff p is prime (ez).
