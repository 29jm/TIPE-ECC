Curve characteristics:
 - |E(F_p)| = k.r, k < 4, r > 2^160		(1)
 - |E(F_p)| != p						(2)

Brute-force: check. Using a large group cardinality mitigates the attack.
Baby steps - giant steps: check. Memory use is prohibitive with large group cardinalities.
Polhig-Hellman: check. Using a group of cardinality k.r with r a large prime, r small mitigates the attack.
Pollard-rho: Large group cardinality should be enough. -> verify.
Attack on anomalous curves: (2) prevents the attack entirely.
Frey-RÃ¼ck: check. The order of p as an element of F_r^x (multiplicative group of F_r) is at least 20.
 -> prevents solving the ECDLP in F_p^20 (infeasible).
