We present the basic framework of elliptic curves and elliptic curve cryptography, and in particular Schoof's point counting algorithm. We investigate and implement an algorithm to generate new elliptic curves suitable for use in cryptographic applications first though point counting, then though the complex multiplication method. We provide an optimized implementation and comparison of these approaches. In the process, we implement the elements necessary for working with elliptic curves along with tools to ensure their security, based on state-of-the-art requirements.
